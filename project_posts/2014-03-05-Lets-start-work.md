The initial version of the application was developed in the framework of Hackaton and therefore was very simple just as proof of concept. Positive feedback from users has allowed me to formulate further objectives.

First, the image scaling algorithm should be improved to take into account the screen orientation and to use all screen area.

Secondly, the screensaver users need the ability to configure parameters such as images change rate, characters to use and their size.

And I will now do the implementation of these ideas.
