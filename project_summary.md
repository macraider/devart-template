# ASCII Art Dreaming

## Description

This application is a screensaver for Android that displays photos from your device styled as ASCII artwork. I thought that the user may be interested to look at his photos in a new way. I developed an screensaver application (also known as daydream) that appeared in Android 4.2 and run while the machine is idle and/or connected to dock station or charger.
